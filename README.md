# Secure-Data-Hiding
This project implements a secure data-hiding technique using ECC encryption, QR codes, and LSB steganography. The system encrypts a message, encodes it into a QR code, and embeds the code into an image. This approach ensures data confidentiality and integrity, making it suitable for secure communication.
